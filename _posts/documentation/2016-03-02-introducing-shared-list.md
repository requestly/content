We are proud to announce the release of `Share Rules` feature. We have found various instances on Social Media where
 people are trying to Share Requestly Rules with other users. Earlier, there was no straight forward way to share Rules 
 so we decided to implement this feature within Requestly to help users ease the Share workflow.


## How to Share Rules

Please follow these steps:

   1. Select one (or more) rules you want to share
   2. Click on share icon on toolbar
   3. If you are not logged in Login with your Google account and repeat 1,2 
   4. You will get a Public Url which you can give to other users over email or other social channels.
   5. You can also provide a meaningful name to your list for future reference.
   6. You can view your shared lists by clicking `Shared Lists` in left rail
